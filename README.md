# FastAPI Mirrorlist implementation
This project is kind of a proof of concept of implementing a repository Mirrorlist using FastAPI. 
In addition, the project uses nginx and traefik to operate.

Example URL:  
http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=8&arch=x86_64&repo=BaseOS  

Application URL:  
http://fastapi.localhost/?release=8&arch=x86_64&repo=BaseOS
